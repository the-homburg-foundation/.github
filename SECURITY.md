## 1. Purpose
The Homburg Foundation develops and maintains free and open software. This Security Policy defines expected standards for reporting and handling security issues. Anyone may report security concerns, but governance and resolution authority is reserved for Foundation members.

## 2. Reporting Security Issues
- Report security vulnerabilities responsibly through the designated channels.  
- Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce, affected systems, and potential impact.  
- Do not publicly disclose security issues until they are resolved or authorized by Foundation members.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all Foundation-managed repositories, software, and related infrastructure.

## 4. Governance and Resolution
Only Foundation members may review, triage, and resolve security issues. Members must:
- Act transparently and impartially.  
- Prioritize timely and thorough investigation.  
- Communicate resolutions responsibly to affected parties.

## 5. Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in:
- Revocation of access to Foundation-managed repositories.  
- Exclusion from project activities.  
- For members: suspension or revocation of governance privileges.

Severity and impact determine the enforcement actions.

## 6. Amendments
The Foundation may update this Security Policy as needed. All revisions are dated and versioned.
